# ðŸ“Œ Operating Systems - Project
> This repository contains Operating Systems projects, covering process synchronization, memory management, and CPU scheduling.


## ðŸ“œ About
The projects involve:

- **Process Management**: Created multi-process structures with fork(), exec(), and wait(), exploring process trees.
- **Thread Synchronization**: Solved reader-writer problems with pthreads, semaphores, and mutexes.
- **Shared Memory**: Implemented interprocess communication via sys/shm.h for efficient memory access.
- **Memory Management**: Simulated paging, segmentation, and virtual memory allocation.
